* Note: Use alligator clips with the potentiometer. The wires on the device are too large.

* Was able to to read from a potentiometer.
- Code is found in the repo.
- Code is simple, as it does the following:
    > Sets up an analog pin to read from.
    > Reads value from specified analog pin.
    > Prints value from specified analog pin to terminal.

* To connect to bluetooth module:
- Connect to the module using bluetooth on your device
- Open your device manager to locate which port(s) are being used
- Use puTTy to ssh into your bluetooth module. 
    > You may need to try multiple ports before finding the right one.
- The computer connected to the module should be the one that sees the code executed.
- The password as "1234".

* Created a test program for the arduino.
- Program receives input and prints it back out to the terminal.

* Switched from Arduino Nano to Arduino Mega - Solved the issue of uploading code.

* Understood how Arduino uploads work.
- At the time of upload, the bluetooth module must be disconnected from the arduino.
- 3V and GND may be connected, but TX and RX must be disconnected.
- Use TX0 and RX0 on the Arduino Mega.
- After uploading code, connect TX and RX to bluetooth module.
- Another user should be able to ssh into the arduino (using puTTy for example).
- User was able to type a character and see it echoed back to their terminal.
