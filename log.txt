* Created a test program for the arduino.
- Program receives input and prints it back out to the terminal.

* Switched from Arduino Nano to Arduino Mega - Solved the issue of uploading code.

* Understood how Arduino uploads work.
- At the time of upload, the bluetooth module must be disconnected from the arduino.
- 3V# and GND may be connected, but TX and RX must be disconnected.
- Use TX0 and RX0 on the Arduino Mega.
- After uploading code, connect TX and RX to bluetooth module.
- Another user should be able to ssh into the arduino (using puTTy for example).
- User was able to type a character and see it echoed back to their terminal.
